<p>There is an existing MyRadio schema in the target database, but it is not the latest version. MyRadio will upgrade this schema. Once the upgrade is complete, older versions of MyRadio may no longer work.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span>There is already a MyRadio schema in the target database, and it is running a new version of MyRadio than the one you are currently trying to set up. MyRadio will not alter the schema, however it may not work properly. Please consider upgrading to the latest version of MyRadio.</div>

<p>The target database already contains the latest version of the MyRadio schema. MyRadio setup will not do anything to the database at this stage.</p>
