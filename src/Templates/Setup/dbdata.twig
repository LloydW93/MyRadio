<p>Since you're just getting started with MyRadio, we'd like to know how much you want us to set up for you. There's options from a complete, ready-to-go set of roles and permissions to a completely blank slate.</p>
<p>When MyRadio is updated, new options will be made available according to the choice you make here.</p>
<p>
<form action="?c=dbdata" method="POST"><input type="hidden" name="mode" value="complete">
<input type="submit" class="btn btn-default" value="Complete starting set"> Start me off with everything I need to get going.
</form>
