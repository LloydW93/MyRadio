<p>{{config.short_name}}'s Committee is the group of people that make sure our student radio station keeps on running - all day, every day.
These are the people you'll want to contact about pretty much anything.</p>
<p><em>See a vacant position that interests you? It's easy to join the committee at any time throughout the year. Just ask anyone in the Management Team for more information.</em></p>
